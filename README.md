# DIP-Image-Restoration-Homomorphic-filtering-
Implementation of Image Restoration wiener filtering to deblur the images, notch filter to denoise the image and Homomorphic filtering 

a) Image Restoration

Given following two blurred images, use the wiener filtering to deblur the images.

Given a noisy image, observe the frequency spectrum, and design a notch filter to denoise the image
 
Given a noisy image, observe the frequency spectrum, and design a band reject filter to denoise the image.
  
  
	
  
b) Homomorphic filtering
	 
Given an image, apply following filters to enhance the image in Frequency domain. Then, recover these images from frequency domain to spatial domain. 

1. Ideal highpass filter 
 
2. Butterworth highpass filter 
 
3. Gaussian highpass filter
